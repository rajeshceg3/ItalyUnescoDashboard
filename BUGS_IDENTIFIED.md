# Bugs Identified

1.  **`scraper.py`: Overly Broad Exception Handling**
    *   **Description:** The scraper uses a generic `except Exception as e`, which can hide specific errors (e.g., network issues, file I/O problems) and make debugging difficult.
    *   **File:** `scraper.py`

2.  **`app.py`: Incorrect DataFrame Indexing**
    *   **Description:** The `/api/sites/<int:site_id>` endpoint uses `sites[site_id]` to access a row. This is not the correct way to select a row by its integer position in a pandas DataFrame and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors depending on the DataFrame's index. The correct method for positional indexing is `sites.iloc[site_id]`.
    *   **File:** `app.py`

3.  **`app.py`: Missing Error Handling for Out-of-Bounds Access**
    *   **Description:** When a `site_id` is requested that is outside the valid range of the DataFrame's rows, the application throws an `IndexError`, resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error. It should instead return a 404 Not Found error.
    *   **File:** `app.py`
