    # Deployment Step
    # Recommended Platform: Render (for Python/Docker apps)
    # Why: Easiest setup, handles Docker native, free tier available.
    # To enable:
    # 1. Create a Web Service on Render connected to this repo.
    # 2. Get the "Deploy Hook URL" from Render settings.
    # 3. Add it as a repository secret named RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL.
